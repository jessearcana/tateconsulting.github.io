# Services

## Early Intervention Services

Using a **play-based approach grounded in Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA)**, sessions are designed to build meaningful skills that help your child thrive at home, in school, and in the community.

Sessions can focus on **targeting skills directly with your child** or **providing strategies and support for parents** to use at home and in everyday routines.

Penelope’s services can be accessed with NDIS funding (plan-managed or self-managed) or privately. All fees are charged in line with the current NDIS price guide.

**Areas of support include:**
  - Communication and language development
  - Behaviour support and reduction strategies
  - Play skills
  - Social skills
  - Emotional understanding and perspective taking
  - Self-help and independence skills
  - Desensitisation programs for barriers to daily living (such as haircuts, nail trimming, and toothbrushing)
