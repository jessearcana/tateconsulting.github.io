# Outcomes
Apex Arcana reviewed the technology and the company’s business development activities. Alternative routes to market were identified and analysed. Arcana’s blend of start-up, business management and technical experience allowed the use of different frameworks and tools to assess the costs, benefits and risks.

A recommended strategy was selected and developed into a business plan for consideration. We iterated on this plan to consider how de-risking could be brought forward, and how stages of investment could be aligned with activities that would build knowledge about the market and begin to build intangible value for the client. The strategy brought new focus to important areas identified during the project, as well as validating and refining some exciting opportunities already known to the client.

Understanding the technology, and some likely challenges, Arcana worked with the client’s subject matter experts as well as leveraging our experience and networks to refine the potential options. It was important to bring together the natural competitive advantages of the client, with the opportunity this technology represents in a global competitive landscape. We presented a draft report early, and meeting face to face helped as we brought in new ideas and knowledge that needed to be reviewed and integrated.

The report was presented to the company, and the recommendations are guiding its commercialisation efforts.
