# Outcomes
It’s been 2 years since Angus and I started Arcana with a broad aim to explore what we could build together and provide consulting services in the AI and big data space.

We’ve been reviewing our work and will link to some stories about completed projects over the coming week. It’s been fun to explore a diverse range of domains and we’ve found different areas of our own expertise come to the fore in response to client needs. This has included data science, business development planning and technical exploration of technologies and solutions. Applying entrepreneurial thinking with deep experience in AI and research has allowed us to approach projects with a broad view and bring clients along as we focus in on specific areas of maximum value.

In parallel, we’ve been experimenting with new paradigms in search, question answering and large language models. We’ve all been impressed by the simplicity of dumping a handful of files into a vector database, stuffing relevant results into an LLM via prompts, and getting answers in a proof of concept. It’s interesting to see that the generative component which is a big part of the appeal in such systems can also lead to the introduction of noise and reliability issues.
