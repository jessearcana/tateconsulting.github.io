# Outcomes
We set out to explore the available data and tools that could be used, via a proof-of-concept analysis. Apex Arcana delivered:
 - Business analysis including requirements clarification with stakeholders and subject matter experts
 - Appropriate data pre-processing for use in-situ
 - Machine learning prototype code to be evaluated
 - Statistically valid (proven) methods for validating the analysis
 - Support for execution and troubleshooting in the client cloud environment

The code, system and report were presented to the client. The report included recommendations for further work and analysis of the opportunity. The client is continuing to progress the prototype based on this work.
