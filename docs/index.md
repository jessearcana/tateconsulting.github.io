# Nurturing skills, cultivating futures

ABN 81 936 143 390

**Helping children grow through play, connection, and evidence-based support.**

I provide warm, neuro-affirming therapy for children with developmental delays, tailored to each child and family. With a play-based and fun approach, I come to you at home, childcare, or in the community across Adelaide.

My strategies draw on behavioural principles such as prompting, reinforcement, and gradual shaping to teach new skills step by step.


**I can support your child to:**
  - Learn to communicate and express themselves
  - Build play and leisure skills
  - Develop self-care and independence
  - Strengthen social and emotional skills
  - Reduce barriers to daily life, such as difficulties with transitions, waiting, or tolerating “no”
  - Increase confidence with routines like haircuts, nail trimming, and toothbrushing
