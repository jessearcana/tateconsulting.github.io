# Nurturing skills, cultivating futures

I provide evidence-based neuro-affirming therapy to children with delays (Autism, speech delay, Global developmental delays). I tailor each program to suit the individual and family's needs. I come to you in the home, childcare or community setting, across Adelaide metro.

I use behavioural principles such as prompting and reinforcement to teach new skills and gradual shaping from one approximation to the next. I can help to teach your child to communicate, engage in leisure activities, self-care skills, and skills needed to reduce behaviours of concern such as transitioning, waiting and tolerating no.

**Areas of Practice:**
- Applied Behaviour Analysis
- Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
- Challenging Behaviour Reduction
- Early Intensive Behaviour Intervention
- Emotions and Perspective Taking
- Functional Communication
- Relational Frame Theory
- Social Skills
- Speech and Language Development
